# GUI Cheatsheets

This repository contains random cheatsheets that you can look up to find what you require or start out on when making any kind of GUI

## Contents

### 1. Tkinter Cheatsheet
    
    Contains everything you might need to start out with building an UI using Tkinter.

    This is mostly written as a lookup table in cheatsheet form so you can copy paste from this directly and modify as required

    (If using VS code or any other such software, just clone it and copy paste as required)
